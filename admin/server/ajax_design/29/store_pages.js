Standard bearings would simply not last as long due to these pressures. You will only require a C3 clearance bearing if you are replacing one that states C3 on it.<br />	<br />	<strong><span>How do I return/exchange an item?</span></strong><br />	<br />	Please select our Returns icon this will explain everything regarding returning goods for either credit or exchange.<br />	<br />	<strong><span>How do I select the Timing belt width I require?</span></strong><br />	<br />	If you select the pitch and length you require, click on the title of the item this will take you to the next page where you will see in the top right hand corner ‘Please select belt width’, click on the arrow and a drop down box will appear with all available widths and prices.</p><p>	<span><strong>> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCXMICrjKd4">How do I remove the seals from a bearing</a>?</strong></span></p><p>	<span><strong>> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wEqt-jlqVg"><span><strong>How do I remove the shields from a bearing</strong></span>?</a></strong></span></p><p>	<span><strong>> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fT4axK3haQ0"><span><strong>How do I fit a Taperlock Bush</strong></span></a>?</strong></span></p><p>	<span><strong><span><strong>> </strong></span><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJa7eVGriho">How do I Break a chain</a>?</strong></span></p><p></p>'};
